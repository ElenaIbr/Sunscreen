    <string name="low_level_message">A UV index reading of 0 to 2 means low danger from the Sun UV rays for the average person. Wear sunglasses on bright days. If you burn easily, cover up and use broad spectrum SPF 15+ sunscreen. Bright surfaces, sand, water, and snow will increase UV exposure.</string>
    <string name="moderate_level_message">A UV index reading of 3 to 5 means moderate risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Stay in shade near midday when the Sun is strongest. If outdoors, wear sun-protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and UV-blocking sunglasses. Generously apply broad spectrum SPF 15+ sunscreen every 1.5 hours, even on cloudy days, and after swimming or sweating.</string>
    <string name="high_level_message">A UV index reading of 6 to 7 means high risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Protection against skin and eye damage is needed. If outdoors, seek shade and wear sun-protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and UV-blocking sunglasses. Generously apply broad spectrum SPF 15+ sunscreen every 1.5 hours, even on cloudy days, and after swimming or sweating.</string>
    <string name="very_high_level_message">A UV index reading of 8 to 10 means very high risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure.

If outdoors, seek shade and wear sun-protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and UV-blocking sunglasses. Generously apply broad spectrum SPF 15+ sunscreen every 1.5 hours, even on cloudy days, and after swimming or sweating.</string>
